You might be tempted to just start doing stuff, but you should
tell Git who you are first:

git config --global uers.name "Your name"
git config --global uers.email your@email.com

Create a new local repository:

git init

To clone a directory, just hit the button on the Git page that 
copies the pathfile, then go to the console and type:

git clone the pathfile(http......)

to update your git files from the respository:

git pull

Add files to your repository that you made locally

git add (file name) or (* for all files in current directory)
