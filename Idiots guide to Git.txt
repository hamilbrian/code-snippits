You might be tempted to just start doing stuff, but you should
tell Git who you are first:

git config --global uers.name "Your name"
git config --global uers.email your@email.com

Create a new local repository:

git init

To clone a directory, just hit the button on the Git page that 
copies the pathfile, then go to the console and type:

git clone the pathfile(http......)

To update your git files from the respository:

git pull

git merge <branch to bring into yours>

Add files to your repository that you made locally:

git add (file name) or (* for all files in current directory)

To commit your changes:

git commit -m "always leave a message talking about your changes"

git commit -a (this will add everything, including yours added files)

Push your changes to the repository, it's a best practice to have a
dev or working branch and only commit to the master file when necessary:

git push origin "branch name here"

Check your status with the repository:

git status

Best practice, make a new branch:

git checkout -b <name your branch>

git checkout <switch branches>

git branch (this will list all the branches)
